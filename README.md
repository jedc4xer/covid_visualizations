Visualize COVID Trends - (Working, but incomplete)
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly program that can be used to download and visualize COVID trends based on data 
from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 that was referenced by the John Hopkins COVID tracking team.

Data Attribution: JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data

Other capabilities that are not yet implemented include: 
 - Save a set of states for easy tracking by choosing them, and then saving the list to a file that is checked when the program loads.
 - Display a table with summary statistics
 - Improve Graphical Display
