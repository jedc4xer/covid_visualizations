Visualize COVID Trends - (Working, but incomplete)
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly program that can be used to download and visualize COVID trends based on data in a github account that was
referenced by John Hopkins COVID tracking team.

Other capabilities that are not implemented include: 
 - Save a set of states for easy tracking by choosing them, and then saving the list to a file that is checked when the program loads.
 - Display a table with summary statistics
 - Improve Graphical Display
